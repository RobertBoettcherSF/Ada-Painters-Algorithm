# Painter's Algorithm in Ada 2023

## Project Overview
The Painter's Algorithm (also known as priority fill or depth-sort rendering) is a classic 3D computer graphics technique for hidden-surface determination[cite: 1, 2]. Polygons in a scene are ordered by distance from the viewpoint and rasterized into the framebuffer from farthest to nearest, allowing closer geometry to naturally overpaint more distant elements[cite: 1, 2]. This Ada 2023 implementation provides four core algorithmic variants: standard depth-sort based on maximum Z values, centroid depth-sort, the Newell-Newell-Sancha priority sorting method with bounding-box overlap heuristics, and a dependency-graph topological sort capable of detecting unresolvable cyclic overlaps[cite: 1, 2].

## Features
* **Standard Depth Sort:** Farthest-to-nearest rendering ordered by maximum polygon depth (`Max_Depth`)[cite: 1, 2].
* **Centroid Depth Sort:** Geometric center ordering (`Centroid_Depth`) providing balanced depth estimation across tilted polygons[cite: 1, 2].
* **Newell-Newell-Sancha Heuristics:** Pairwise overlap resolution testing 1D Z-extents and 2D bounding boxes before sorting[cite: 1, 2].
* **Topological Sort & Cycle Detection:** Builds a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of polygon overlaps, sorts in topological order, and raises `Cyclic_Overlap_Error` when mutual occlusions form a cycle[cite: 1, 2].
* **Scanline / Ray-Casting Rasterizer:** 2D point-in-convex-polygon rasterization over a strongly typed `Framebuffer` matrix[cite: 1, 2].
* **Strong Typing & Contracts:** Fully annotated with Ada 2023 contracts (`Pre`, `Post`, and `Global => null`) and domain subtypes for screen dimensions and depth values[cite: 1, 2].

## Testing
The test suite (`tests.adb`) performs systematic verification and validation:
1. **Functional Correctness:** Validates depth algorithms (min/max/centroid), 2D polygon intersection math, bounding box queries, and framebuffer clearing[cite: 1, 2].
2. **Algorithm Variants:** Directly verifies ordering and rendering output for Standard, Centroid, Newell-Newell-Sancha, and Topological approaches[cite: 1, 2].
3. **Overpainting Validation:** Validates pixel overwrites within the buffer to confirm that foreground geometry correctly supersedes background fragments[cite: 1, 2].
4. **Edge Cases & Error Handling:** Exercises empty arrays, single-polygon arrays, out-of-bounds geometries, and exception checking on invalid geometry constraints[cite: 1, 2].

## Building
* **Compiler:** GNAT supporting Ada 2022/Ada 2023 (`-gnat2022` or `-gnat2023`)[cite: 1, 2].
* **Standard Flags:** Builds with `-gnatwa` (all warnings enabled) with zero compiler warnings[cite: 1, 2].
* **Prerequisites:** GNAT compiler toolchain (`gnatmake` or `gprbuild`) and standard GNU Make[cite: 1, 2].
